	 * 		# used to represent real world object/things.
	 * 		# its a collection/group of objects having similar structure and behavior.
	 * 		# also called template/blueprint of object.
	 * 		# class contains properties and methods.
	 * 		# also known as reference data type or user defined data type.
	 * 
	 * 		syntax :
	 * 		
	 * 		class class_name{
	 * 
	 * 			// properties/features/instance variables
	 *
	 * 			// methods/function/responsibilities
	 * 
	 * 		}
	 * 
	 * 
	 *	# Object/Instance :
	 * 		# implementation of class.
	 * 		# instance of class is called object and vice versa.
	 * 		# object contains instance variables and instance methods.
	 * 		# class allocates memory when object is created.
	 * 
	 * 		syntax :
	 * 
	 * 		class_name object_name = new class_name();
	 * 
	 * 		e.g.
	 * 		A a = new A();
	 * 		Student s = new Student();
