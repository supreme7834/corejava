	 * 			  is known as abstract class.

	 * 						-> method which does not have implementation or body
	 * 						e.g.
	 * 							abstract void sum();
	 * 
	 * 			# every abstract class must have at least one child class and child class must override 
	 * 			  abstract methods.
	 * 
	 * 			# we can't create object of abstract class.

	 * 			// non-abstract methods
	 * 				e.g.

	 *  			
	 *  			# every interface have at least one implementation class and impl. class must override abstract
	 *  			  methods.
